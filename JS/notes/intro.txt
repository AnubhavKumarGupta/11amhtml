1. internal JS: 
it means we can include JS into HTML internally by using script tag

<script>
   console.log("this is interanl js")
</script>
it prints 'this is internal js' in console of brower developer tools

ii. External JS: we can even write JS externally and attach it
<script src="./index.js"></script>

it is always recommanded to add JS at the end of body.why?
always browser gives more priority to Js so that it might shows invalid html/css.
