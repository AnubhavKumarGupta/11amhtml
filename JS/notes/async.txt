JS is basically synchronous so it ignores asynchronous and when callstack got emptied , async will run
Timers
 -- setTimeOut(callback,time in milli seconds)
 -- setInterval(callback,time in milli seconds) -- it runs
 for every interval of time
 -- To stop timeOut,you can use clearTimeOut();
 -- to stop interval,you can use clearInterval()
